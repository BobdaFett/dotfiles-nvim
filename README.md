# Dotfiles!

These are my own personal dotfiles, which I use for development with Neovim.

I still get some funny errors every once in a while, specifically with Noice.nvim integration, but these will be ironed out in time.

As of right now, this configuration has been proven to work with Rust, C#, Lua with Vim config, HTML (without tag completion) and XML (again, no tag completion.)

This will grow as time goes on.
